```{r setup, include=FALSE}
if(!require(gridExtra)) install.packages('gridExtra')
source('read_data.R')
```

```{r prepare data}
terms = get_term_data()
students = get_student_sub()
terms_sub = merge(terms, students[,c('mellon_id','admitdate')], by="mellon_id")
```

# Where do we have summer terms?
```{r}
table(terms_sub[,c('term_part_code','term_part_desc')])
```
We are interested in term part code 51, which in general does not occur that much.
```{r}
1-(sum(terms_sub$term_part_code %in% c("03", "14", "92")) / length(terms_sub$term_part_code))
```
In around 1% of the terms it is other than Fall, Winter or Spring.

```{r}
ggplot(terms_sub, aes(fill=admitdate, x=term_part_code)) + 
    geom_bar(position="stack", stat="count")
```
Summer terms were only tracked from 2015 or 2016 on.

Conclusion: do not include summer terms for comparability.
